Wex
===

Wex is an IEx-like utility that runs code in the browser.

This gives us some interesting possibilities: popup windows for help,
asynchronous output, continuous compilation with errors and warnings
flagged in the source, and so on.

This is at best a prototype, so tread lightly. But, if you feel like
contributing, there is a list of things to do on the issues page.

To run Wex:

* git clone
* cd wex
* bower install
* mix run --no-halt

Enjoy
